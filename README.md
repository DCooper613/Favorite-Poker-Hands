1) Royal Flush - Spades

Spades are my favorite suit with playing cards and a Royal Flush is the best hand you can make in Texas Hold 'Em so its fitting to start the list off with this beauty!

2) Straight Flush - Diamonds

Coming in second we have the diamonds making an appearance. They're pretty but can also cut deep if you're not careful
